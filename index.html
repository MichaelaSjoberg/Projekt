      <p>Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.
        Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us. The warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.
        The ice giant Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical calculations. Using predictions made by Urbain Le Verrier, Johann Galle discovered the planet in 1846. The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea, as suggested by Le Verrier</p>

    <h2>Jupiter</h2>
    <img class="planetbild" src="jupiter.jpg" alt="image of jupiter"/>
    <p>Jupiter: The Basics Namesake: King of the Roman gods. Date of Discovery: Known to the ancients. Orbit: Approximately 484 million miles from the sun (five times as far from the Sun as the Earth is).Day: Approximately 10 Earth hours. Year: Approximately 12 Earth years. Average diameter: Approximately 88,846 miles.
      Surface gravity: Approximately 2.5 times Earth's.</p>

    <h2>Saturnus</h2>

    <p>Saturn: The Basics Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. All four gas giant planets have rings -- made of chunks of ice and rock -- but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's. Like the other gas giants, Saturn is mostly a massive ball of hydrogen and helium. Distance from the sun: About 900 million miles, nearly 10 times as far as Earth is from the sun.
      Year: About 29 Earth years. Day: About 10.7 Earth hours. Diameter: About 72,000 miles, nine times the size of Earth.</p>

      <p>The Latest Dec. 21, 2018: New NASA research confirms that Saturn is losing its iconic rings at the maximum rate estimated from Voyager 1 & 2 observations made decades ago. The rings are being pulled into Saturn by gravity as a dusty rain of ice particles under the influence of Saturn’s magnetic field.</p>

    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second largest planet in our solar system. Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings—made of chunks of ice and rock—but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium</p>
